# Verification

Choose checks by the final diff. Documentation-only edits need link/command validation and `git diff --check`; they do not require compiling every application. Implementation changes need the relevant package tests, types, build, and any affected security or quality gates. Run the broad gate for cross-package work and release readiness, or when explicitly requested.

| Scope | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Repository types and tests | `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` |
| Code quality | `pnpm quality` |
| Production build validation | `pnpm verify:build` |
| Performance budgets | `pnpm perf:check`, `pnpm perf:test`, `pnpm perf:runtime` |
| Release manifest | `pnpm release:test` |
| Rust compile | `pnpm tauri:check` |
| Hosted runner | `pnpm --filter @fable/hosted-runner test`, `pnpm --filter @fable/hosted-runner build` |
| Full repository gate | `pnpm check` |

For Rust changes, use the affected tests plus:

`cargo fmt --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check`

`cargo clippy --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`

`cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

UI changes need browser/native inspection of affected flows and relevant viewport sizes. Packaging, Docker availability, authentication, deployment, and live smoke tests are separate evidence. Wrangler dry-runs establish packaging and bindings only. Report skipped checks and missing prerequisites without describing them as passes.
